# liri-node-app
I have created an app to let the user pick choose what information they want displayed. They can choose to see a specific movie (title, release year, ratings, where it was produced, in what language it is in, the plot or storyline, and what actors star in the movie). All they need to do is simply type in movie-this followed by the "title" of the movie they are interested in.
Not only does the app consist of movie information it can also search for a specific song name the user would like information on. By entering in spotify-this-song followed by "song title" information on the specific song will appear.
What is even more exciting about this app is the twitter function. This app will call a specific twitter user's tweets by entering in my-tweets. This will display the latest tweets that were tweeted by the specific user (ME).
And last - this app will also pull information from a .txt document. You can add whatever it is you would like in the document and call do-what-it-says within node and it will pull the information listed in that specific .txt doc.
So give it a try! and Enjoy!
